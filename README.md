# Onlydust casestudy

## Context

The goal of this case study was to develop a react app composed of a button opening a drawer while being as close as possible to the Figma provided.

## Notes

To accelerate the development and showcases my skills, a few packages was used, notably :
- react-tabs
- react-hook-form
- framer-motion

To better improve the user experience through visuals feedbacks, an async function has been mocked for the form submitting, animations when necessary has been implemented, and some form validation.

For the developer experience, the files and folder have been ordered with feature driven and code colocation in mind. Comments through the html are here to better guide new developers on the codebase.

I would have love to showcase more creative skills with the use of more [Framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/) or even [Rive.app](https://rive.app/). I did my best in an half a day of work.

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
